## Stack I'm using
- Next.js w TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- axios
- js-cookie


## Pages
- Home
    - Leaderboard
        get all users sorted according to points, and display them
    - Bet-able matches
        - Match (Component)
          home and away team names with crest, inputform, submit button
          get match details and show it with a form
          using formik or react-hook-forms will be better for this.

- Signup/Login
    - use auth 
    - show strapi response errors in form or toast notifications
- News
    - display scraped news articles
